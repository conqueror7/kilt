Introduction
------------

Kilt is a set of small tools to convert Java i18n resource bundles to
XLS(X) and vice versa. It also contains a generator for a facade to access
the translation resources in type-safe manner.

Kilt is available as:

 * a standalone application 
 * an ant task to be integrated with an ant-based application 
 * a maven plugin to be integrated with a maven-based application


=== Supports translation workflow

Kilt supports the translation workflow inside a company by providing the
translation resources (Java i18n resource bundles) as a more
translator-friendly XLS(X) sheet. The translation team can then do their
translations directly inside the XLS(X) sheet. The translated sheet can then
be imported back into the actual resource bundles used by the application. 

.Common translation workflow with Kilt
image::workflow.svg[Common translation workflow with Kilt]

The import of the XLS(X) file into the Java i18n resource bundles is
minimally invasive. It does not change the order of the entries in the
resource bundles and all comments and empty lines are preserverd.

The same is true for the export to XLS(X). No reordering is done to entries
that already exist in the sheet and all cell sizes, colors etc. remain as
they are.


=== Type-safe access to i18n resources

Since the usual approach of accessing translated resources in Java uses
strings it is quite error-prone, since typos are common and the software
developer needs to know the exact name of the resource bundle keys.

Kilt eases the usage of translated resoures by allowing to generate enum
facades for resource bundles to allow type-safe access to these resources.
This approach not only shows problems with localization at compile time,
but it is also easy for the developers to find the necessary resources by 
utilizing the code completion of modern IDEs.

The generated enum facades even contain the actual translated values in the
javadoc of the facades enum values and therefore makes it even easier to
spot if the selected resource contains the correct value for the indented
purpose.

Kilt functions
--------------

Kilt provides three commands

export-xls:: Exports the translations in Java i18n resource bundle files into an
XLS(X) file.

import-xls:: Imports the translations from an XLS(X) file back into the Java
i18n resource bundle files.

create-facade:: Creates the I18n enum facades for type safe access to
localized messages.

Those commands are described in more detail in the following sections.


=== Export Java i18n resource bundles to XLS(X)

Kilt can generates Excel sheets as either XLS or XLSX and is able to modify
both of them. To do this kilt reads the given Java i18n resource bundles
and writes their contents to an existing XLS(X) file or creates a new one.
Each row in the generated XLS(X) sheet corresponds to a key in a resource
bundle. The actual translations are added as columns to that rows.

//TODO: Screenshot eines Sheets

It's recommended to let Kilt generate the first XLS(X) sheet, since Kilt
makes certain assumptions about the structure of that files. Afterwards
that file may be prettified to be better readable for the translators. Kilt
will only modify the actual translation contents in subsequent generation
steps.

The generation of an XLS sheet for Java i18n resource bundles works closely
together with the reimport of that sheet to provide a common translation
workflow. Please see the next section of how to import the translation
sheet back into the Java i18n resource bundles.


=== Import translations from XLS(X) back into Java i18n resource bundles

An XLS(X) file with updated translations can be reimported back into the
Java i18n resource bundles with Kilt.

Kilt will only update values that actually have changed and it will not
reorder the resource bundle files (although translated keys that are
missing in the resources bundles will be added to the end of the file).

Kilt also allows removing keys from the resource bundles that are missing
from the translated XLS(X), but does not do so by default. (TBD)


=== Creating a Java facade for type safe access to localized messages

Kilt allows the generation of a Java facade for accessing the available
resource bundle entries in a type safe manner. It provides an additional
accessor class for easier access to the values of the resource bundle
entries.

The accessor class can even be used for resource bundles without a
generated facade.


==== Usage of the Java Facade

Kilt provides the class `I18n` for accessing the resource bundles keys of
the generated enum facades as well as keys of resource bundles without a
generated facade. See the {javadoc-url}[Javadoc] for details of using this accessor
class.

A typical usage is:

[source,java]
----
// create an accessor class for the default locale
final I18n i18n= new I18n();
// get the value for the key "KEY_MESSAGE_HELLO" from the generated enum
// facade "Messages"
final String translatedValue= i18n.get(Messages.KEY_MESSAGES_HELLO);
// get the value for the key "otherKey" from the bundle "otherBundle"
// for which no facade was generated
final String valueFromOtherBundle= I18n.get("otherBundle", "otherKey");
----

//TODO: Sollte das noch irgendwo in der Einleitung beschrieben werden?
The accessor class allows marking missing translations instead of throwing
a MissingResourceException. This allow to easily spot missing translations
without breaking the functionality of the application.

.Example screenshot of a marked missing translation
image::screenshot_marked_missing_translation.png[Screenshot of a marked
missing translation]

Translations are marked only after no fallback translation can be found.

For example if you have the following bundles:

----
messages_de_DE.properties
messages_de_AT.properties
messages_de.properties
messages.properties
----

and your current locale is `de_AT` the translation for a resource entry
will searched in the following files in this order:

 1. messages_de_AT.properties
 2. messages_de.properties
 3. messages.properties

Only if the key is not found in any of the above files the resource will be
marked as missing. This is no special behaviour of Kilt, but the normal
strategy of Java for finding translations.

Missing translations are marked by default. If you want the normal Java
behaviour of throwing a MissingResourceException instead, configure the I18n
accessor accordingly.

To use the accessor class you need import the `kilt-runtime` jar. Either
download it from the {download-page}[Download] section or add it to your project via
the maven coordinates:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>de.poiu.kilt</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilt-runtime</artifactId>
        <version>{kilt-version}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
----
// I18n in combination with enum Facades


Usage
-----

Kilt can be used in three different ways. 

 * As a standalone application
 * As an ant task
 * As a maven plugin

=== Standalone tool

To use Kilt as a standalone tool, download and unpack the kilt-bin package
from the {download-page}[Download] page.

It contains a shell script for Linux and a batch file for windows and a
kilt.properties file for the configuration.

To execute the tool run

----
./kilt.sh <command>
----

on Linux or 

----
kilt.bat <command>
----

on Windows.

You may override the configuration in the kilt.properties file by
specifying some properties as parameters to the command. For example to
create an XLS(X) sheet only for the english language run

----
./kilt.sh create-xls --i18nIncludes=**/*_en*.properties
----

See <<_commands>> for a list of the available commands and <<_parameters>>
for a detailed description of the available configuration parameters.

To show the usage help of the tool call with the parameter `-h` or `--help`

----
./kilt.sh --help
----

To show the usage help of a specific command use the command `help`
followed by the required command

----
./kilt.sh help export-xls
----

// TODO: Autocompletion?


=== Ant task

To use Kilt as an ant task, download and unpack the kilt-ant package from
the {download-page}[Download] page.

It contains a build.xml file and kilt.properties file to be used
standalone (but still requires ant to be run) or as a sample to be
integrated into the build script of another application.

To execute a command run

----
ant <command>
----

See <<_commands>> for a list of the available commands and <<_parameters>>
for a detailed description of the available configuration parameters.


=== Maven plugin

You can use the maven plugin to import and export an XLS(X) sheet on the
fly, but since translations are usually an iterative process and will be
done more than once, it is much more common to configure the
kilt-maven-plugin for the project containing the Java i18n resource bundle
files.

However, usually it is not necessary to generate an XLS(X) sheet with every
build, therefore the corresponding maven goal is not bound to any maven
lifecycle phase by default.

To integrate the kilt-maven-plugin into your application include the
following plugin section in the pom or your project:                 
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>de.poiu.kilt</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{kilt-version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    <plugins>
  <build>
----
//TODO: Da oben sollte man eine Beispielkonfiguration angeben

See <<maven-plugin.adoc#exportXls,the Kilt Maven Plugin description>> for a 
detailed description of the available configuration parameters.

To execute a goal run 

----
mvn kilt:<command>
----

You may override the configuration of the pom by specifying some properties
as parameters to the command. For example to create an XLS sheet only for
the english language run

----
mvn kilt:export-xls -Di18nIncludes=**/*_en*.properties
----


Commands
--------

Kilt provides three commands. These names of these commands is the same for
the commands in the stanalone tool, the ant tasks and the maven goals.

export-xls:: Exports the translations in Java i18n resource bundle files into an
XLS(X) file.

import-xls:: Imports the translations from an XLS(X) file back into the Java
i18n resource bundle files.

create-facade:: Creates the I18n enum facades for type safe access to
localized messages.


Parameters
----------

Kilt supports the following parameters that can be set in the configuration
files for the standalone tool and the ant tasks and in the plugin
configuration of the maven plugin.

All parameters can additionally be given on command line parameters to
override the configuration for the standalone tool and the maven plugin.
The parameters of the ant task can not be overridden.

The following list describes the available parameters and to which commands
they apply.
